    <p>I'm currently writing a monograph based on my PhD research, which studiedÂ how 1990s/early 2000s postfeminist discourses of female empowerment shaped contemporary media aimed at women. </p>

    <p>My work analyses how pop culture navigates the contradictory effects that growing up during this time period had on female identity.</p>

    <div class="line"></div>
    <p>I found that in narratives about women in their late twenties and early thirties like <i>Gone Girl</i> and <i>Girls</i>, there was an overwhelming sense of loss, disappointment and failure. Protagonists like Amy Dunne and Hannah Horvath who have grown up on a diet of <i>Sex and the City</i> come to realise that consumerism and sexual liberation is not delivering the promise of happiness or fulfilment.</p>

    <p>This contrasts with coming-of-age stories like <i>The Hunger Games</i>, where resilient young women are seen as capable of overcoming and adapting to much harsher dystopian conditions.</p>
    <p> The aim of my research was to map and understand these contrasts, and to explore the ongoing legacy of postfeminism.</p>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <p>I teach Critical and Contextual Studies at University of Salford and Critical and Cultural Theory at Manchester Metropolitan University.</p>

    <p>For the past year I worked with FACT Liverpool as an AHRC-funded Researcher & Writer in Residence, contributing to The Future World of Work project and partnering with the Learning Team to create research-led workshops on gender and sexuality for young people.</p>
